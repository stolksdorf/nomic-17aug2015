##### 103: Turn Structure
> One turn consists of three parts in this order: 

>> (1) propose one rule-change.

>> (2) generate a random number between 1 and 6<sup>1</sup>. That number is added to the player's score.

>> (3) proposed rule change is voted on and either accepted or declined. If accepted, the change takes effect immediately.

##### 108: Rule of Expediency
> Exactly 24 hours after a proposal is created votes can no longer be cast and the decision criteria are evaluated (ie. vote is tallied) as per rule 104. Players who fail to vote before this time are not included in determining whether a decision is made as per rule 104. In the event that no votes are cast the rule-change is passed.
