##### 103: Turn Structure
> One turn consists of three parts in this order: 

>> (1) propose one rule-change.

>> (2) proposed rule change is voted on and either accepted or declined. If accepted, the change takes effect immediately.

>> (3) generate a random number between 1 and 6<sup>1</sup>. That number, plus the number of approvals of this player's proposal, is added to the player's score.

##### 104: The Layer Cake Rule
> Any rule proposal that involves a rule numbered from 000 to 099 inclusively, requires unanimous votes among the eligible voters to be adopted.

> Any rule proposal that involves a rule numbered from 100 to 199 inclusively, requires a majority of the votes among the eligible voters to be adopted.

> Any rule proposal that involves a rule numbered from 200 to 299 inclusively, requires a 30% of the votes among the eligible voters to be adopted.

> Any rule proposal that involves a rule numbered from 300 to 399 inclusively, requires a single vote from an eligible voter that has a veto, other than then player that proposed the rule, to be adopted.

> If a rule proposal involves multiple rules, the rule with the lowest cardinal number is used to determine the voting threshold mention aboved.

##### 108: The Grand Admiralty Rule
> The player known as DukeKataron is to be granted the title of Grand Admiral. A title which, at present, means absolutely nothing. But it makes the player feel good about himself. Should this player fall in glorious battle, the title passes to JMTyler to carry on the legacy.

##### 200: Noble Dog Gives Noble Buck 
> When a player proposes a rule change, they may leave one (1) inspirational quote or funny joke in their initial comment description to earn one (1) Mackenzie-Buck. If a joke's comedic value or a quote's inspirational merit is in question, the arbiter<sup>1</sup>, **ktrain**, will rule and Mackenzie-Buck will be awarded accordingly.

##### 110: Let's Keep This Gravy Train Rolling
> If the current player in the turn order does not propose a rule within three days of their turn starting, that player is moved to the bottom of the turn order and the turn passes to the next player. The second time a player's turn is passed during a single round, they are not moved to the bottom of the turn order, thereby losing their turn for that round entirely.
